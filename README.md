# Photo Foodie 🍽️📸

A mobile app that automatically discovers your restaurant visits by analyzing your camera roll. It groups photos by location and time, detects food using on-device ML, and matches visits to restaurants — including 15,000+ Michelin-rated establishments worldwide.

## Features

- **Camera Roll Scanning** — Batch processes your entire photo library with native performance
- **Location Clustering** — Groups photos into visits based on GPS coordinates and time proximity
- **Food Detection** — Uses on-device Vision ML to identify food photos within each cluster
- **Michelin Matching** — Automatically suggests nearby Michelin-starred restaurants (1-3 stars, Bib Gourmand, Selected)
- **Apple Maps + Google Places** — Search any restaurant via MapKit or Google Maps API
- **Calendar Integration** — Matches visits to calendar events and creates visits from reservation entries
- **Review Workflow** — Confirm, reject, or reassign restaurant matches
- **Visit History** — Track all confirmed restaurants with visit counts and photo galleries

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- Yarn 4 (set via `packageManager` in package.json)
- Xcode 15+ (for iOS)
- Android Studio (for Android)
- A physical device recommended (iOS Simulator lacks photo library with location data)

> **Note:** Expo Go is not supported due to native module dependencies.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Build and Run

```bash
# iOS
yarn ios

# Android
yarn android
```

### 3. Grant Permissions

When prompted, grant **full photo library access** — the app needs to read GPS metadata from all photos to discover restaurant visits.

## How It Works

### 1. Scanning

The app reads all photos from your camera roll, extracting photo IDs, timestamps, and GPS coordinates. On iOS, a custom native module (`BatchAssetInfo`) processes photos in batches for maximum speed.

### 2. Clustering

Photos are grouped into "visits" using a spatial-temporal algorithm:

- Photos within **2 hours** of each other AND
- Within **200 meters** of each other

Each cluster represents a potential restaurant visit.

### 3. Food Detection

A sample of photos from each cluster is analyzed using iOS Vision framework to detect food content. Visits with detected food are prioritized in the review queue.

### 4. Restaurant Matching

For each cluster, the app suggests nearby Michelin restaurants (within 100m). The bundled dataset includes 3-star, 2-star, 1-star, Bib Gourmand, and Michelin Selected restaurants.

### 5. Calendar Enrichment

The app matches visits to calendar events and can create visits directly from restaurant reservations in your calendar.

### 6. Review & Confirm

Users review pending visits in the **Review** tab — confirm the suggested restaurant, search for a different one, or reject as not a restaurant visit.

## Scripts

```bash
yarn server:dev   # Run the Hono backend with Vite reload on all interfaces
yarn build        # Build the backend into dist/server
yarn server:start # Start the compiled backend
yarn start        # Alias for yarn server:start
yarn seed:canonical-restaurants # Seed backend canonical restaurants from assets/michelin.db
yarn seed:demo-social           # Seed demo social users and visits
yarn ios          # Build and run on iOS
yarn android      # Build and run on Android
yarn web          # Start Expo for web
yarn typecheck    # Run TypeScript checks
yarn lint         # Run oxlint
yarn clean        # Remove build artifacts & node_modules
```

## Backend Seeding

The backend now supports two local seed flows:

```bash
yarn seed:canonical-restaurants
yarn seed:demo-social --viewer-email you@example.com
```

- `seed:canonical-restaurants` reads the bundled `assets/michelin.db` and upserts canonical Michelin restaurants into Postgres.
- `seed:demo-social` creates a small network of public demo users, their follows, and confirmed visits. Use `--viewer-email` (or `--viewer-id`) to have an existing account follow the demo users so the feed populates immediately.
- In production, demo users are hidden from normal social search/results unless the viewer email is included in `DEMO_USER_VISIBLE_EMAILS`.
